# What is LeetCode?

LeetCode is an online platform that provides a collection of programming challenges for developers to practice their coding skills. The platform is particularly focused on algorithmic and data structure problems, and supports multiple programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

LeetCode problems are grouped by difficulty level, and each problem presents a specific challenge that requires the developer to solve using code. Users can submit their solutions and receive immediate feedback on the correctness and efficiency of their code. They can also compare their solutions with other developers, learn from others' approaches, and discuss various coding techniques and strategies.

LeetCode is widely used by software engineers and developers to improve their coding skills, prepare for technical interviews, and participate in coding contests. It is a popular resource for interview preparation, as many companies use similar coding challenges during their technical interview process.
